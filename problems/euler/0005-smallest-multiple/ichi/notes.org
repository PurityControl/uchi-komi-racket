#+TITLE: Notes for smallest multiple problem

The idea is to create a recursive call that is tail
optimised increasing the multiple by the largest number
in the list of factors on each call.
The first call where each factor is divisible by the
multiple is returned.

** Retrospective

Need to be more comfortable about the difference between
lists and sequences and the problems caused by contract
violations when passing apply a sequence.
