#+TITLE: Notes for largest palindrome product

racket excels in list generation and the for*/list method made
filtering out all 3 digit palindrome products very straightforward.
However string utilities seem weaker with the palindrome? function
being more complicated than it should need to be, unless of course
racket can do this more eloquently and I am just unaware of it.
