#+TITLE: Notes for Largets Product In Grid
 

** Retrospective
built up functionally, used one large single dimesional
vector with function to pull out co-ordinates rather than
2d vector.
Not sure if sequence length, grid length and grid-vector
are passed around needlessly but it seemed to be appropriate
for a functional solution.
May be a better way to operate on lists that return variable
length sequence lists including possibly an empty list.
