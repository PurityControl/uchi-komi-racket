#+TITLE: Retrospective for Sieve of Eratosthenes

- Reasonable performant up to about 1,000,000 then starts to require a lot
  of memory.
- Use standard functional accumulator to build up list for seiving.
- Have to reverse lists as using cons to build up the list of primes.
- Could be made more succinct by using standard higher order functions as
  abstractions for the process.
